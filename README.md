This python code simulates coin flips. Assume heads = 1 and tails = 0, or vice versa. Flip the coin n times and
compute the sum. Repeat the experiment m times. Therefore there are m sums. Create a histogram recording the
frequency of each sum. The results are compared to the theoretical predictions as dictated by the central limit 
theorem (a Gaussian distribution). See central_limit.pdf for more details.

This code requires numpy and matplotlib libraries.
